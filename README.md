Terminal phone book application for learning purposes.

### General Information ###
* Quick summary
Terminal phone book application written in Python 3.5.2. It works as a system of records using user's input and saving data in non-encrypted .data file. The code isn't DRY. Code refactoring and testing wasn't in the scope of this exercise so it's ugly and dirty but it works :)
